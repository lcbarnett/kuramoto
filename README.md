# kuramoto
An efficient C implementation of the standard Kuramoto coupled oscillators system, with Matlab interface.

To compile the C code, in a terminal navigate to the C directory and type 'make'.

To build the Matlab interface, in Matlab navigate to the Matlab directory and run 'makemex' at the Matlab prompt. (You can also run 'make' at a terminal in the Matlab directory, but you will need the 'mex' and 'makemex' executables on your system executable path.)

(Tested in Linux with gcc, MacOS with gcc and Clang, and Windows with MinGW.)

If someone would like to contribute a Python (Numpy) interface, please contact the maintainer.
